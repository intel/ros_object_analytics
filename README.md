# ros_object_analytics
Object Analytics (OA) is ROS wrapper for realtime object detection, localization and tracking.
These packages aim to provide real-time object analyses over RGB-D camera inputs, enabling ROS developer to easily create amazing robotics advanced features, like intelligent collision avoidance and semantic SLAM. It consumes [sensor_msgs::PointClould2](http://docs.ros.org/api/sensor_msgs/html/msg/PointCloud2.html) data delivered by RGB-D camera, publishing topics on [object detection](https://github.com/intel/object_msgs), [object tracking](https://github.com/intel/ros_object_analytics/tree/master/object_analytics_msgs), and [object localization](https://github.com/intel/ros_object_analytics/object_analytics_msgs) in 3D camera coordination system.

OA keeps integrating with various "state-of-the-art" algorithms.
* Object detection offload to GPU, [ros_opencl_caffe](https://github.com/intel/ros_opencl_caffe), with Yolo v2 model and [OpenCL Caffe](https://github.com/01org/caffe/wiki/clCaffe#yolo2-model-support) framework
* Object detection offload to VPU, [ros_intel_movidius_ncs (devel branch)](https://github.com/intel/ros_intel_movidius_ncs/tree/devel/), with MobileNet SSD model and Caffe framework

## compiling dependencies
  ROS packages from [ros-kinetic-desktop-full](http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu)
 * roscpp
  * nodelet
  * std_msgs
  * sensor_msgs
  * geometry_msgs
  * dynamic_reconfigure
  * pcl_conversions
  * cv_bridge
  * libpcl-all
  * libpcl-all-dev
  * ros-kinetic-opencv3

  Other ROS packages
  * [object_msgs](https://github.com/intel/object_msgs)
  * [ros_intel_movidius_ncs](https://github.com/intel/ros_intel_movidius_ncs) or [opencl_caffe](https://github.com/intel/ros_opencl_caffe)

  NOTE: OA depends on tracking feature from OpenCV (3.3 preferred, 3.2 minimum). The tracking feature is recently provided by ROS Kinetic package "ros-kinetic-opencv3" (where OpenCV **3.3.1** is integrated). However, if you're using an old version of ROS Kinetic (where OpenCV **3.2** is integrated), tracking feature is not provided. In such case you need self-build tracking from [opencv_contrib](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib). It is important to keep opencv_contrib (self-built) and opencv (ROS Kinetic provided) in the same OpenCV version that can be checked from "/opt/ros/kinetic/share/opencv3/package.xml"

  Frequently used options
  * **input_points** Specify arg "input_points" for the name of the topic publishing the [sensor_msgs::PointCloud2](http://docs.ros.org/api/sensor_msgs/html/msg/PointCloud2.html) messages by RGB-D camera. Default is "/camera/depth_registered/points" (topic compliant with [ROS OpenNI launch](http://wiki.ros.org/openni_launch))
  * **aging_th** Specifiy tracking aging threshold, number of frames since last detection to deactivate the tracking. Default is 16.
