/** @class TrackingManager
 * Manage multiple trackings, each against one object detected across camera frames.
 *
 * TrackingManager owns a list of trackings. A tracking is added to the list when it is initially detected, see
 * @ref detect(). Then in the successive frames, every tracking is updated independently, see @ref track().
 *
 * For an object detected, TrackingManager search the existing list if it is tracked already. A detected object
 * has its own object name (e.g. person, dog, etc.) and a roi (region of interest, also known as bounding box). The
 * roi's matching level is measured by its overlapping rate and its centor deviation, see @ref
 * model::ObjectUtils::getMatch(). A @ref kMatchThreshold is used as the minimum matching level of roi. By matching
 * the object name and the roi, see @ref getTracking(), TrackingManager find an existing tracking for this object. Or
 * a new tracking should be added, see @ref addTracking().
 *
 * TrackingManager maintains a @ref tracking_cnt. When adding a new tracking, the value of tracking_cnt will be
 * assigned to that tracking, as a unique ID across frames. Then the tracking_cnt automatically increased by one.
 *
 * TrackingManager also maintains a @ref kProbabilityThreshold, only when detected with a confidence level not less
 * than this threshold will the object be added to the tracking list. This is necessary to mask any unexpected or
 * unstable detection results.
 *
 * For a tracked object, TrackingManager keep updating tracking roi in the successive tracking frames, even this object
 * might not be detected in those frames. The tracking is considered "active", till its @ref aging_ reaches a threshold.
 * TrackingManager maintains a @kAgeingThreshold specify the maximum age of an active tracking. Trackings below this
 * age are actively updated when tracking frame arrives. Trackings above this age are consider inactive, and to be
 * removed from the list.

 * Paralleling computation is enabled in TrackingManager, supported by openmp from compilers. @ref kNumOfThread
 * specifies the number of threads used for paralleling computation. Usually this should be less than the maximum
 * number of threads supported by the platform.
